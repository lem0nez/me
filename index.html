    <div class="about">
      <p>
        My first-ever programming language was
        <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.compuphase.com/pawn/">Pawn</a>, which I
        used to script the game logic. Interest in C++ development started back in 2018 when I
        decided to learn more meaningful language to build my future career on it. Now I'm using
        <b>Rust</b> as my primary language to develop blockchain solutions. Backend development is
        not my only skill, also I have the strong experience with the <b>DevOps</b> stuff: clusters
        management, CI / CD set up and creation of Helm charts.
      <p>
        I'm that person who wants everything to be <b>minimal</b> and <b>fast</b>. I prefer to keep
        learning, continue challenging myself and do interesting things that matter. As
        well-organized person, fan of cycling and other outdoor activities, I'm interested in
        working on ambitious projects with <u>positive</u> people.
